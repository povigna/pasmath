# TODO

## Current Issues:

- The problem with exponentiation still needs resolution.

## Immediate Goals:

1. Correct all existing bugs, with a primary focus on fixing the exponentiation issue.
2. Introduce the percentage operator ("%"), equivalent to "/100."
3. Optimize and generalize the code as much as possible in preparation for future implementations.
4. Consider implementing text file output by version 0.30 for increased reliability.

## Future Plans:

1. Implement functions.
2. Extend support for complex numbers.
3. Incorporate fraction functionality.

## Note:

The addition of complex numbers and fractions poses a significant challenge, and careful consideration will be given to choose the most suitable solution.
