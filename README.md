## Overview
PASMath, version 0.22, is a mathematical expression evaluator designed for basic arithmetic operations. This program is distributed under the terms of the GPL (Gnu Public License), copyright (C) 2001 Michele Povigna, Carmelo Spiccia, with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

## Features
- Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
- Numerically evaluates expressions and displays intermediate steps.
- Improved handling of the positive sign in the second operand (e.g., 5*+2 should now function correctly).
- Corrected handling of null results in individual operations (e.g., -4-3+3 would previously return 40 and not 4+0).
- Write 'QUIT' to exit the program.
