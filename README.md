## Overview
PASMath, version 0.26 alpha, is a mathematical expression evaluator designed for basic arithmetic operations. This program is distributed under the terms of the GPL (Gnu Public License), copyright (C) 2001 Michele Povigna, Carmelo Spiccia, with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

### Recent Updates
- Resolved several bugs, including some severe ones.
- Improved expression visualization.
- Added support for the factorial operator (!); note that there's currently no check for the positivity and integer requirement of the factorial operand.
- Experimental support for absolute value and implicit products coming soon.

Please test it when you have some time.

**Note:** This update introduces version 0.26 alpha and includes bug fixes and new features, with ongoing development for additional functionalities.

## Features
- Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
- Numerically evaluates expressions and displays intermediate steps.
- Improved handling of the positive sign in the second operand.
- Corrected handling of null results in individual operations.
- Added support for parentheses in expressions.
- Handles division by zero and the indeterminate form `0^0`.
- Supports the factorial operator (!).
- Experimental support for absolute value and implicit products (upcoming).
